#  SwiftGUI4OCRmyPDF

This is a side project to learn swiftui.

While on macos there is already a way to ocr pdfs (with https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionkit ?), I am used to ocr my pdf (https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
But ocr my pdf has only a cli interface. So I created a simple Swift GUI to help me ocr my pdfs.
